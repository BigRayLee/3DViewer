/**
 * Camera Frustum
 *
 * A restricted class of frustum for which 
 * l, r, t, b, n and f can be associated to scalar values. 
 *
 * The physical parameters of interest in the camera are:
 *
 *	1) Focal Length  : L
 *	2) Sensor Width  : W
 *	3) Sensor Height : H
 * 
 * Only the (unit less) ratios between them matter for rendering, and only 
 * subsets of two of these ratios are independent. We choose:
 * 
 *	aspect_x := L / W = 1 / (2 * tan(fov_x / 2)),
 *	aspect_y := L / W = 1 / (2 * tan(fov_y / 2)),
 * 
 * because they are closely linked to projection matrices.
 *
 * The lense axis is assumed perpendicular to the sensor plane, but may be 
 * shifted with respect to sensore center. In terms of frustum planes:
 *
 *	shift_x = (r+l)/(r-l),
 *	shift_y = (t+b)/(t-b).
 *
 * An additional option for (non physical) orthographic camera frustum
 * is added. In that case aspects and shifts have a to be reinterpreted.
